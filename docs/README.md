# ECG viewer

Plots ECGs recorded with the Attys (http://www.attys.tech)
using the Dygraphs (http://dygraphs.com)
library and jquery (https://jquery.com/).

For example within AttysECG you can share the recorded 
ECG via e-mail or google drive and then the recipient simply drops the 
ECG file into this ECG viewer.

The ECG viewer allows panning, zooming and you can create printouts
by simply using the print option of your web browser.

## How to run

  - Copy all files from this directory into a local folder or on a web server.
  - Point your web browser to index.html.
  - Drop a .tsv file into the drag/drop zone or browse for the .tsv file.

Try it out with the sample ecg provided here on github.
